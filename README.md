### Background
Hyperproperties generalize properties of individual computation traces in that they relate such traces to each other. This is needed to express information flow security policies, such as observational determinism: A systems behavior should appear to be deterministic to an external observer, i.e., there should be no information leakage of certain secrets into the public domain.

HyperLTL, which extends linear-time temporal logic (LTL) with explicit trace quantification, is a recently introduced temporal logic capable of formalizing many hyperproperties of interest. However, formalizing hyperproperties in HyperLTL can be error-prone, since we have to consider multiple traces at the same time.

### Applications
*EAHyper* can be used to automatically detect specifications which are vacuously true or inconsistent and
to check implication and equivalence between multiple formalizations of the same requirement.

With *EAHyper*, an overhead in verification processes, such as model checking (check out [MCHyper](https://www.react.uni-saarland.de/tools/mchyper/)) or monitoring, may be avoided by detecting erroneous or redundant specifications reliably and easily at an early stage during the verification process. *EAHyper* can also be used to understand formalized hyperproperties better, for example, the many different variations of information flow policies considered by the security community.
